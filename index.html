        <p class="desc">Prodigy, the annual symposium of the Production department,
             is back again, offering a refreshing set of events, workshops,
              guest lectures, and quizzes that will keep your minds sharp and 
              hone your skills. A student-run organization that aims at encouraging
               technological innovation and the development of managerial skills,
                Prodigy'23 allows you a chance to test your expertise by
                 competing with fellow prodigies and finding out where you stand.
                  With outreach programs and events conducted in various cities
                   throughout the year, months of hard work reach a crescendo in the 
                   last two days, attracting more than 1000 students from various other
                    colleges as Prodigy strives to break boundaries and test the limits
                     of the technological world. With each passing edition, Prodigy refines
                      itself to become even better. Prodigy'23 attempts to break its own record 
                      and promises nothing short of a phenomenal experience that will leave
                       you amazed at the marvels of technology.</p>
